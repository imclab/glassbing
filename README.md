What's worse than wiping out an entire alien race with a planet destroying weapon?
Making Google Glass's Google feature redirect to Bing, of course.

This works by replacing the Google Now results screen with one that chucks the crappy Google results out the window
and launches the browser for Bing Search.

This is tested on a Nexus 7 with the Xenologer APKs, not an actual Glass unit, as I'm not a Glass Explorer. 
To run on an actual Glass unit, first sideload a browser such as Chrome, then sideload the below APK.
